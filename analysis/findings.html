Weather models forecasted weather showers in the valley by 4 PM.  \nLocal news and weather discussions were that the air mass in the valley has been relatively dry, with convective inhibition that has a capping inversion.

Several wildfires with relatively local smoke impacts and night time drainage flows were impacting air quality across the state ranging from teh Clearwater Basin, north into the Idaho Panhandle, and into the Treasure Valley.  Fires were burning in Kennewick and Walla Walla, WA as well as in central Oregon and southern California.","The Walker Fire located 8 miles SW of Idaho City, Idaho started October 10, 2015 and quickly spread from approximately 65 acres to 2500 acres due to strong winds.  Smoke impacted much of the southern portion of Idaho.","Air quality ranged from moderate to unhealthy due to smoke impacts from regional fires that were burning in Washington State, Oregon, California and a multitude of local fires that were burning in the Clearwater drainage.","Large fire complexes throughout the Pacific NW region, Central Panhandle Mountains of Idaho and Northern Idaho Panhandle contributed to smokey conditions and high PM2.5 concentrations.","Prolonged periods of strong gusty winds led to widespread dust on August 14, 2015.

Gusts as high as 47 mph were measured by the local NWS site in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho - generating widespread dust.","Preliminary review of data suggests that an extreme windstorm caused widespread power outages which lasted several days.  During which time residents had to heat their homes with wood until electricity was restored. This contributed to exceedances of the 24-hour PM2.5 standard at the Spokane -Augusta Avenue monitor.","Drought conditions led to many wildfires in several parts of British Columbia, Canada, including one near Pemberton. North winds transported smoke and ozone precursors from the Pemberton area, about 250- 300 miles north of the Enumclaw monitor, to Puget Sound beginning on July 5. Due to strong subsidence, the smoke descended and flowed over Seattle on July 8 and 9. VOCs in the wildfire smoke are likely to have combined with urban NOx and increased ozone production by 10- 15 ppb.","A windstorm slammed the region, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers. Peak wind gust between 3 and 4 PM at Spokane International Airport reached 71 mph. At the Kennewick site, a maximum wind speed of 32 mph were recorded at 2 PM.  Wind gusts peaked at 45mph and coarse particulate matter levels spiked sharply between 11 AM and 2 PM and between 5 and 7 PM.","Drought conditions and warmer than normal temperatures prevailed over the preceding five months. This made soil entrainment more likely during high winds. Southwest winds had been blowing at 10- 15 mph since late the previous night, and a trace of rain fell at the Pasco airport at 7 AM. 1-hour average wind speeds remained above 16 mph between 9 AM and 4PM. PM10 levels also remained elevated during this window, with a peak of 1,846 ?g/m? coinciding with the peak wind speed of 29 mph. The source region of PM10 impacting the Kennewick monitor on October 30, 2015, could stretch from nearby to as far as 100 miles southwest.\n\nThis was not a localized event: upper level winds of 40 mph were modeled across much of eastern Washington. Windblown dust in other parts of the Columbia Basin was also responsible for visibility-related closures of I-90 during this period. \n","Winter 14-15 had historically low snowpack levels and the snow melted early. A record setting heat wave in June set up conditions for dust entrainment in wind. Temperatures on the 13th were over 100 degrees in the area.  Then, on Friday August 14, a strong cold front brought wind that caused substantial blowing dust that affected most of the region. Strong southwest winds with 1-min speeds up to 38 mph blew from about 2 AM through the rest of the day. These winds brought particulate matter from nearby to as far as 100 miles away, to and past the Kennewick monitor. Poor visibility was reported along Highway 395 near Ritzville and south toward the Tri-Cities; multiple traffic accidents were reported by 2:54 PM.","Northwest winds in excess of 15 mph on August 21 lead to low PM2.5 concentrations in the Yakima valley. Regional flow turned northeast and winds dropped to around 5 mph on August 22, leading to much smoke from the many fires in northeast Washington making its way to Yakima. By Aug 23, light winds had shifted to the southwest but much smoke from the previous day still remained trapped in the valley. Light southwest winds continued for the next several days, placing Yakima about 60 miles downwind of the Cougar Creek fire. However, after the smoke from more distant (northeast Washington) fires had cleared, subtle wind shifts occurred, ensuring that Yakima was not directly downwind of the Cougar Creek fire. These helped prevent excessive smoke from building up in Yakima after the 24th.\n\nSmoke impacts from these same fires burning across the state moved into western Washington over the weekend of August 22nd and 23rd, causing unhealthy air quality and exceedances in western Washington on August 23rd.","The cause of the event is 4th of July (Independence Day) fireworks. There was rapid rise of PM2.5 from fireworks on the evening if July 4 2016 that resulted in an exceedance of the PM2.5 24-hour standard. Hourly average wind speeds were quite low, resulting in stagnant conditions for the evening of the 4th and into the morning of July 5, leading to excessive accumulation of PM2.5. A statistical test of significance was performed on the FRM 24-hour concentrations for July 4 and 5 relative to June and July of 2012-15 (with July 4 and 5 removed). The FRM values observed on July 4 and 5 of 2015 (34.6 and 44.5 ug/m3, respectively) were significant at levels of 1E-22, and 1E-30, respectively, which is many orders of magnitude beyond typical significance levels of 1E-2 or 1E-3. Outside of the heating season, April through October, the only exceedances occur in July on either the 4th or 5th indicating that the PM2.5 buildup is almost certainly due to smoke from fireworks.","On June 8 and 9, 2015, a regional stratospheric ozone intrusion appears to have elevate ground level ozone over most of Utah and Colorado.","Extensive smoke transported from fires in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana may have contributed to elevated ozone throughout the Front Range region.

<li>Findings: <em>A legal loophole has allowed the US Environmental Protection Agency to strike pollution from clean air tallies in more than 70 counties, enabling local regulators to claim the air was cleaner than it really was for <strong>at least 21 million Americans</strong>.</em></li>
