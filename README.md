# air-quality-exceptional-events
This repository contains data and findings that are part of a collaboration between MuckRock, the California Newsroom and the Guardian about the use of a legal tool called the exceptional events rule, which allows local air agencies across the United States to remove bad air days from the record if the data is effected by an "exceptional event," like a wildfire. 

You can find analysis for earlier work about wildfire pollution from MuckRock and the California Newsroom in [`california-wildfire-pollution`](https://github.com/MuckRock/california-wildfire-pollution) and [`gao-wildfire-exceptions`](https://github.com/MuckRock/gao-wildfire-exceptions). The data and analysis driving the investigations of MuckRock's news team is cataloged in [`news-team`](https://github.com/MuckRock/news-team).
