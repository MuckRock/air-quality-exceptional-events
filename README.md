# air-quality-exceptional-events
This repository contains data and findings that are part of a collaboration between MuckRock, the California Newsroom and the Guardian about the use of a legal tool called the exceptional events rule, which allows local air agencies across the United States to remove bad air days from the records of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if the data is affected by an "exceptional event," like a wildfire. 

You can find earlier work about wildfire pollution from MuckRock and the California Newsroom in [`california-wildfire-pollution`](https://github.com/MuckRock/california-wildfire-pollution) and [`gao-wildfire-exceptions`](https://github.com/MuckRock/gao-wildfire-exceptions). More data and analysis driving the investigations of MuckRock's news team is cataloged in [`news-team`](https://github.com/MuckRock/news-team).

## Data

### EPA's Air Quality System 
The [EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS)](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) is a hub of all the different types of air quality data the EPA collects across the country. These data are provided by the EPA in different forms for scientists and members of the public to analyze data primarily in the context of public health, according to the EPA. 

One year ago, we noticed a column in some of these publicly available datasets called “Events Included.” When we referred back to the [AQS data dictionary](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/AQS_Data_Dictionary.html), we found that this column indicates whether the data recorded includes or excludes data that was affected by [an exceptional event](https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/treatment-air-quality-data-influenced-exceptional-events-homepage-exceptional). This is the only data on exceptional events that the EPA makes available to the public. 

### AQS Readings 
Over a period of several months, we negotiated a data request with the EPA to recieve more extensive AQS data that includes variables and information mentioned in [the slides from both older](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-05/documents/webinar_on_exceptional_events_mitigation_plans_20180418_508.pdf) and [more recent presentations within the EPA’s air quality department](https://cleanairact.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Exceptional-Events-Program-Updates-Beth-Palma.pdf).
